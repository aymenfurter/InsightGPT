Whilst walking my dog across the local sports field in the village ofLlangwm in Pembrokeshire, I spotted in the North West a very bright light, which Ithought to be a very bright star. It did seem a little too large and bright howeverbut after looking at it for about 10m seconds I turned to head back home. I now had myback to the star and was walking in a southerly direction.Suddenly something shot across the sky and the whole field was lit up.I looked up to see no object, only a long white trail. This lasted a few minutes untilit began to break up. The sky that night was really clear and the moon was not visibleat this time. I have never seen anything like this before. I can not say I saw anycraft but it was a very real and disturbing event. It could have been a meteorite; Idon't know. I contacted the coastguard who had not had any reports and I also asked afriend in the police to check also.If anyone else saw this I would like to hear.

Pleasefind below my account of what I saw on 25 November 2008. I know it is not much butyou never know!On Tuesday 25 November 2008 I witnessed a strange light in the sky, it was at about a45 degree angle. I was travelling in the car on the M54from Shrewsbury to Cannock, and I witnessed a strange traiangular shape in the sky(it was on my right side). I saw the object from just past junction 6 (M54) toJunction 2 (M54) when I couldn't see that part of the sky anymore. I came level withthe object at around junction 4 (M54), it seemed to have stopped in the middle of thesky and wasn't moving. The time I saw the object was approximately 17:10 - 17:30.The object was triangular in shape, with the apex to the right (when I drew level withit at Junction 4). It was a metalic grey in colour, but the flat base end seemed toglow orange. I have attached a (badlysimple) drawing of the object, it really was the most odd thing I have seen. It musthave been a couple of miles from the M54, but it was quite large in shape, couldntreally give an exact size but it must have been at least 15 feet long and 10 feetwide.If you would like further information, please do not hesitate to contact me,Kind regards,atalogue Reference:defe/24/2627/1© Crown Copyright","fileName":"UFO Sightings (2).pdf","pageNumber":57,"isAnalyzed":true},{"entityCategories":[],"date":"","standardCategories":[],"extendedCategories":[{"shape":["object"]},{"position":["Middlewich in Cheshire"]},{"observation":["naked eye"]},{"weather":["cloudy","haze","mist","clear"]},{"date":["Date not given"]}],"evaluations":[{"question":"Was this a positive user experience?","answer":"No"},{"question":"Did this help to solve the problem?","answer":"No"}],"file":{},"text":"The National Archives' reference DEFE 24/2627/1REPORT OF AN UNEXPLAINED AERIAL SIGHTING1. | Date and time of sighting. | Date not given.(Duration of sighting.) 23.20L : |2. | Description of object.

They live in a smallvillage called Culverthorpe a few miles outside of Sleaford. After a few days of looking after thehouse, one evening we were outside and the sky was perfectly clear and the sun had just gone downwhen we noticed 2 white objects over the fields coming towards us. One object was big and roundwhile the other was smaller and almost completely round but seemed to have a sharp edge to it andthis object was moving faster than the bigger one but they both were moving in the same directionover the fields in front of us. The objects didn't make any sound and moved too fast to be balloonsand they basically moved across the sky until we couldn't see them anymore. We were really excitedfrom seeing these objects, and because we still had a day left looking after my Uncles house wedecided to borrow my Dads Digital Camera just in case we saw anything else. On the last night wewere outside in the garden, the stars were out and it was nice and clear. My brothers were takingpictures with the camera and getting Orbs which just seemed to turn up in the pictures, we couldn'tsee them and my view about these Orbs is that most of them are just dust/moisture. When mybrothers were taking pictures they were using the Flash on the camera. After a while of being outsidewe noticed something flashing, coming towards us, moving parallel/horizontal to the ground, overthe trees at the bottom of my Uncles paddock which is at the bottom of his garden. As the objectcame closer we could see that it would flash a white light which covered the entire object, then thelight on it would decrease until it would go out, then it would increase in brightness and then flashand continue increasing, flashing, decreasing in brightness and the light going out. This object wasn'tmaking any sound and my brother[Eiiisljovhé(had the camera took a picture of it. About the sametime he took the picture we noticed another identical object coming from the same direction. As thissecond object was nearly above us we could see there was a smaller object, not perfectly round,which was travelling along with it. This smaller object wasn't flashing, it remained at the samebrightness. BE cook nore pictures of these 2 objects together but because the objects were movingSO slowly EBB ovas0 ctually taking pictures and checking how the pictures were turning out andseeing that they were blurry he was deleting any blurry ones and would try and get better pictures.After he got a clear picture, which is when the 2 objects were right above us, we watched them travelover the house and out of sight. Later on that night we went back outside after we had gone insidefor a while and there was an intense fog and we couldn't see the stars anymore. I think because of themoisture in the air my brothers were getting the Orb pictures.Attached to this e-mail are the pictures of the objects we saw. Number 63 is the first object we sawand was taken just as the light on the object had gone out but you can just about see the object in thetop centre of the picture. Picture 64 was taken as the second object we saw was overhead and hadflashed, you can see the white light around the object. Near the lower left of the picture is the smallerwhite object.
