# InsightGPT
[![Build and Deploy Angular App](https://github.com/aymenfurter/InsightGPT/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/aymenfurter/InsightGPT/actions/workflows/main.yml)

ðŸ“„ðŸ”Ž InsightGPT enables users to extract text from their uploaded PDF files and uncovers valuable information like dates and locations using Azure OpenAI Service. Users can specify precisely what they wish to analyze within the text by adjusting the settings. To demonstrate it's capabilities, I analyzed UFO sighting reports published by the National Archives in the UK. Extracting information from the unstructured text, such as the shape of the observed object and the type of observation (e.g. naked eye), worked like a charm.
